The following is a python script utilizing the numpy, matplotlib, pandas and the scikit learn(sklearn) library. The programs reads a csv file which contains the hand written letters test dataset which contains the pixel value of the written letters. The dataset was obtained from kaggle.com. The program analyzes the dataset giving count of all letters and also builds a classifier model using logistics regression technique and dimensional reductionality. It returns the precision using confusion matrix.
Please download the csv file from this link and paste it in the same folder as the python script.
